Generative AI: Introduction and Applications – My Notes
This course gave me a solid intro to what Generative AI is and how it's used. Here's what I took away:

What I Learned
Generative AI is all about creating new content—text, images, videos, even code—based on patterns it’s learned from existing data.

It’s different from regular (discriminative) AI, which mainly classifies things instead of generating them.

Cool Things It Can Do
Write full essays or messages (like ChatGPT).

Create detailed images from a text prompt (DALL·E, Midjourney).

Help code faster (GitHub Copilot).

Generate realistic videos or voices (Synthesia).

Even build virtual worlds!

Real-Life Uses
In education, it can help explain complex topics.

In health, it can support doctors with generated reports or images.

Finance, HR, and even entertainment are using it for smarter automation.

Tools We Explored
ChatGPT, Bard – text

DALL·E, Stable Diffusion – images

GitHub Copilot – code

Synthesia – video

IBM’s Generative AI Lab – where I tried things hands-on

Key Concepts
Prompt engineering really matters—how you ask = what you get.

LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT power a lot of this stuff.

My Final Thoughts
This course opened my eyes to how powerful (and creative) AI has become. I can see so many ways to apply this, and I want to keep exploring it—especially tools like ChatGPT and DALL·E.

Generative AI: Prompt Engineering Basics – My Notes
This course focused on how to get better results from AI by improving the way we write prompts. Honestly, I didn’t realize how much of a difference wording could make until now.

What I Learned
Prompt engineering is all about asking the AI the right way. A small tweak in the question can completely change the answer.

There are different styles:

Zero-shot prompts – just ask without examples.

Few-shot prompts – include a couple of examples to guide the AI.

Chain-of-thought – ask the AI to explain step-by-step (great for reasoning tasks).

Tree-of-thought – let the AI explore different paths before reaching a conclusion.

Tools I Used
IBM Watsonx Prompt Lab – tested different types of prompts.

Dust & Spellbook – tools that help track, refine, and improve prompt quality.

Where I Can Apply This
Writing – clearer blog posts, social media captions, or summaries.

Coding – ask AI to generate code, and now I know how to be more specific.

Problem-solving – I can guide the AI to “think out loud” and make smarter decisions.

Final Thoughts
Prompting is a skill, not just guesswork. After this course, I feel more confident when using AI tools because I know how to talk to them in a way that gets better results.
